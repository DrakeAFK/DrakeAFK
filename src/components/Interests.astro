        <p>
            I have been interested in technology all of my life. I received my first PC,
            a now vintage machine that was running Windows 95, when I was three years old.
            I enjoy learning about new technologies and practicing with various programming languages.

        <h2 class="font-bold">Video Games</h2>
        <p>
            I have been playing video games since I was a child with my father. I've never been tied to
            one particular genre of game, but I do enjoy RPGs and FPSs. I'm currently playing through
            Starfield and regularly play Escape from Tarkov.

        <h2 class="font-bold">Mountain Biking & Cycling</h2>
        <p>
            After living on the front range of Colorado, mountain biking quickly became a great
            passion of mine. Having since moved to sunny Florida, I have taken up road and
            gravel cycling.

        <h2 class="font-bold">Rock Climbing</h2>
        <p>
            Whether in a climbing gym or natural rock, climbing and bouldering are not just a physically
            demanding activity, but a very technical sport that promotes problem solving in
            a unique way.
